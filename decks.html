      <h1>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4: What Can We Expect?</h1>
      <p>
        Activision has announced the highly anticipated remaster of Tony Hawk's
        Pro Skater 3 and 4, launching on July 11, 2025. Following the success of
        Pro Skater 1+2, the remastered collection features enhanced 4K graphics,
        classic and new levels, and iconic skaters like Tony Hawk, Rodney
        Mullen, and modern pros like Rayssa Leal and Nyjah Huston. A special
        edition includes the Doom Slayer as a playable character.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notably, the career mode will return to the classic two-minute run
        format from Pro Skater 4. The game will be available on PlayStation,
        Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pre-orders are open for the Standard Edition ($49.99), Digital Deluxe
        Edition ($69.99), and Collector's Edition ($129.99), with Game Pass
